# Wstęp
In this project, children will be introduced to HTML tags & CSS properties. They will also edit tags and properties to make their own customised greeting card.

# Materiały dostępne online

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Intro to HTML and CSS' starting point](https://trinket.io/html/850a678202)
+ ['Birthday Card' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-card](http://jumpto.cc/web-card)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-template)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:
