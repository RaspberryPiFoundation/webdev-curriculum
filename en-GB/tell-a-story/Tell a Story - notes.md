title: Tell a Story — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will have an opportunity to write their own HTML. They will create their own story, adding panels, images and captions to a comic book style webpage.

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Tell a Story' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-story](http://jumpto.cc/web-story)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-template)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Tell a Story' Finished](https://trinket.io/html/c8afdef912)

#Learning Objectives
+ Writing HTML:
	+ `<div>` tag and element grouping;
	+ `<img>` tag and image URLs;
	+ `<h1>` - `<h6>` headings.

#Challenges
+ "Make some changes" - editing HTML content and CSS style;
+ "Keep going!" - applying tags and styling to create a finished story.

#Completing this project offline
+ If children are completing this project offline, they'll need to save images they intend to use in the same folder as their `Story.html` file.

	They can then just add the name of the file in their `<img>` tags:

	```
		<img src="house.png" />
	```
