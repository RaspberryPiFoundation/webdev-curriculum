# Coding Cups & Balls

## Introduction

In this project children make a Web version of the old[^1] *Cups and balls* game. 

> **Three cups and one ball**, can you find under which cup the ball is hidden?

> Moreover, can you use your **coding wizardry** to shuffle the ball under one cup?


<!--### Skills needed

* Basic **HTML**
	* tags (opening, closing and nesting)
* Basic **CSS**
	* `width` and `height` 
	* `color` and `background`-->

## Resources

Files included in this project's *__Resources__* folder

* *jquery.js* 
* *underscore.js*

Software required

* A code editor. We recommend [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* A browser with Developer Tools enabled. We recommend [Google Chrome](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/index.html#eula)


## Learning Objectives

1. Use a **code editor** to write code, and the **browser** to debug it
2. **DRY** (don't repeat yourself): write shared code in one place only 
3. Use **code libraries** instead of "re-inventing the wheel"
4. Use **variables** to store and collect values
5. Use **arguments**  to "ask specific questions" to a function
6. Read and explain the **structure of code**
7. Add code **comments** for clarification and attribution
8. **HTML**
	1. Element introduced: `div` 
	2. Use multiple `class` names on the same element
9. **CSS**
	1. Class `.shortcut`
	2. `border-radius`
	3. `float`
	4. Offsets: `left`, `top` and `bottom`
	5. `:active` pseudo-class
	6. Understand the difference between property *name* and *value*
	
10. **JavaScript**
	1. Use the *Console* as a "chat with your browser"
	2. *Data types*: `string`, `number` and `list` (array)
	3. *Functions*: `alert()`
	4. Familiarise with code libraries: *[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)* and *[jQuery](http://jquery.com/)* 
	5. Use *Underscore* to pick a random element from an array
	6. Use *jQuery* to select and manipulate existing HTML elements
	7. Use *comments* to annotate and "switch off" code
	

## Challenges

1. Use `border-radius` to turn blocks into circles
2. Use `border-bottom`, `border-left` and `border-right` to shape blocks into trapeziums
3. Use `float` to control the document flow
4. Use offsets to move elements within the document
5. Use `:active` to control the behaviour of elements when clicked
6. Piece together separate lines of code in the appropriate sequence



## Frequently asked questions

1. *Why is there a `.` before `ball`?* (or any other `class` name)
2. *How can an empty block have fat borders?*
3. *Why is the ball **under** the cups? It's **above** the cups in my HTML document...*
4. *I copied the X file into here but the Console says it doesn't find it.*
5. *My code makes the Console complain.* 
	
	Check for *syntax errors* in their code: unnecessary spaces, closing tags are missing, brackets are missing, quotation marks are missing, etc
6. *I don't understand this jQuery code...* 
	
	You may have to explain the *jQuery syntax* `selector.function(argument,argument,...)`
