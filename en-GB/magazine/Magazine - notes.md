title: Magazine — Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to create a two-column layout. They will also recap lots of the HTML & CSS that they have learned in other projects. 

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Intro to HTML and CSS' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-intro](http://jumpto.cc/web-intro)
+ ['Magazine' starting point  -- jumpto.cc/web-magazine](http://jumpto.cc/web-magazine)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-template)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

#Learning Objectives
+ This project teaches children how to create a two-column magazine style layout using `float:`. It also recaps lots of the HTML & CSS that is covered in more detail in other projects. Examples are given so children will be able to complete this project even if they have not completed some of the earlier projects. 

#Challenges
+ "Add items to the left column" - placing items inside a floated element;
+ "Add a link back to the first page" - creating links between pages in a project;
+ "Fill in your second page" - recapping more HTML & CSS;
+ "Add another animation" - recapping animations.
