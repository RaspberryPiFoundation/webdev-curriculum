#Introduction:
In this project, children will will have an opportunity to write their own CSS. They will also edit and write CSS properties and selectors to make their own poster.

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Wanted' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-wanted](http://jumpto.cc/web-wanted)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/html-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/html-template)](http://jumpto.cc/html-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:
