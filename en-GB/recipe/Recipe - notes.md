title: Recipe — Volunteer Notes
...

#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn about HTML lists and CSS colours. They will create their own recipe, adding ingredient and method lists.

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online.

For this project, children can make use of this blank trinket ([jumpto.cc/trinket-blank](http:/jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket ([jumpto.cc/trinket-template](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-template)).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

#Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/webdev-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ Template/Template.html
+ Template/style.css

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ RecipeFinished.html
+ style.css
+ banana.jpg

#Learning Objectives
+ Writing HTML:
	+ `<ul>`, `<ol>` and `<li>` list tags;
	+ `<hr/>` tag;
	+ Consolidating the use of nested tags.

+ Writing CSS:
	+ Colours (names & hexadecimal codes).

#Challenges
"More ingredients" - adding more items to an unordered list;
"More steps" - adding more items to an ordered list;
"More colours" - adding colour names, rgb values and hex codes;
"Reviews" - adding another unordered list;
"More styling" - adding images and fonts.

# Using this project offline
If children are completing this project offline, they’ll need to save images they intend to use in the same folder as their Template.html file.

They can then just add the name of the file in their `<img>` tags:

```
<img src="banana.jpg" />
```
