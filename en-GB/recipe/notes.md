# (BETA) Coding a recipe

## Heads up! { .beta}

This project is in **Beta**. This means we're still testing it, and there's a small chance there could be some bugs or typos. 

If you're trying out this project, make sure you [complete this short questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eMCfpYe3v7eYu5M8rSqLKlmq7cczLCLHx66csgyUyVU/viewform) (or email projects@codeclub.org.uk) to let us know how it went! 


## Introduction

In this project children write down a recipe for their favourite dish in HTML. 

> Hey, what's **your favourite dish**? 

> Can you **write down your recipe** for it in HTML so that anyone on the Web can enjoy making it too?


<!--### Skills needed

* Basic **HTML**
	* tags (opening, closing and nesting) -->

## Resources

Files included in this project's *__Resources__* folder

* *banana.jpg*

Software required

* A code editor. We recommend [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
* A browser with Developer Tools enabled. We recommend [Google Chrome](http://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/chrome/browser/index.html#eula)

Children are asked to use their own images in this project, but they may want to source images online. They should therefore be able to access resources like [Flickr Creative Commons](https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/).


## Learning Objectives

1. Use a **code editor** to write code, and the **browser** to debug it
2. Structure a Web page with the **appropriate markup**
3. Identify and use **openly-licensed images**
4. Use CSS to change the **style and layout** of a Web page
5. Understand the **syntactic differences** between HTML and CSS
6. **HTML**
	a. Elements introduced: `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `img`, `h1` 
	b. Understand the conceptual difference between ordered and unordered list
	c. Understand the semantic value of heading tags
		
7. **CSS**
	a. `width` and `height` 
	b. `margin`
	c. typographical properties such as `font-size`, `text-align`, `font-weight`, `line-height`  and `font-family` 
	d. `color` and `background`
	e. Introduce **specificity** 	
	

## Challenges

1. Use `ul` to make a list of ingredients
2. Use `ol` to list the recipe steps
3. Use `img` to add image files to an HTML document
4. Use appropriate tags to mark additional information up
5. Use the browser's Inspector to experiment with CSS properties 
6. Use CSS to improve a Web page accessibility
7. Use `color` and `background-color` to personalize a Web page layout
8. Use specific CSS selectors to override generic rules


## Frequently asked questions

1. *Why has the `img` no closing thing like the others?* 
2. *I copied the X file into here but it doesn't come up in my page.*
3. *My image is too big for this page*
4. *My page looks weird.* 
	
	Check for *syntax errors* in the HTML: unnecessary spaces, closing tags are missing, brackets are missing, quotation marks are missing, etc
5. *My browser is not picking up the CSS I just wrote.*

	Check for *typos* and *syntax errors* in the `style`: unnecessary spaces, brackets are missing, quotation marks are missing, etc 
6. *I changed something in the browser and now it's gone.*

	You may have to explain that changes in the Inspector are temporary. Useful while making a page, but wiped on refresh. Otherwise anyone could hack (or improve) any website :)
